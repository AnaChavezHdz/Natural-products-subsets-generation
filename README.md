# Natural-products-subsets-generation:generation-and-characterization 
Public databases such as the Collection of Open NatUral ProdUcTs and the Universal Natural Product database (UNPD) are rich sources of structures  to be used in generative models. In this work, we report the selection and characterization of the most diverse compounds of natural products from the UNPD using the MaxMin algorithm.

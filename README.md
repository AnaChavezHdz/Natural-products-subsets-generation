# Natural products subsets: Generation and characterization 
Public databases such as the Collection of Open NatUral ProdUcTs and the Universal Natural Product database (UNPD) are rich sources of structures  to be used in generative models. This repository had supplementary information from the original paper (Natural products subsets: generation and characterization) that include:
the MaxMin algorithm and structural diversity implemented in Python language;
the interactive TMPAs;
the new REAL-Enamine subset,
and the three subsets generated from UNPD with 14,994, 7,497, and 4,998 compounds with stereochemical information.
